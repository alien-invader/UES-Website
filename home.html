			<h2>What We Offer</h2>
            <h3>Professional Development</h3>
			<p style="font-size:17px;color:black">

				We are the official student organization of the UCSD Economics Department for undergraduate students.
				With the support of Dr. Melissa Famulari, UES was founded in 2005 with the hopes of establishing a
				stronger network among all undergraduate economics students by using resources and connecting faculty
				from the Economics Department. Since its founding, UES has been expanding and evolving to new heights.
				We provide the resources necessary to prepare our members for embarking on a career in the business
				world or graduate school through various events and workshops. Students have the opportunity to network
				with alumni, corporate representatives, graduate students, UCSD faculty, and each other while being a
				part of an organization designed to enhance the educational and social experience of all interested
				students at UCSD!
